# randobotjava
A (now less) buggy JavaFx robot game I made to play with JavaFx concepts

What have we got here? Hell yeah its a really bad game that shows off JavaFx which is so well loved and respected by
everyone, right? 
You can set the bot and treasure and have the bot wander around aimlessly and randomly until it finds the treasure and so
its like a sick ass convoluted random number generator where the random number is how many turns it takes this pseudo-mindful 
robot to get to an arbitrary spot on the 2D grid.

# Future features
* A manual set of controls so you can be smarter than the robot (for now)
* Resizing the view pane based on how many args you pass in so you don't have to resize manually to find the hidden buttons
(Though it is fun having stupid level easter eggs just to make it functional right?)
* Making it an actual game where the treasure is hidden and you have to find it like a pirate or whatever (Robot Pirates are
a thing, right? Right?)
* A brand new spanking GUI for you to select the arguments passed to this thing without having to know how to type in 
things on a computer screen (its a real issue for some people to type things into a command line instead of typing the exact
same thing in a GUI but you know how it be)
* Gonna make this bot real smart so it can find the treasure quicker and in a future release it will probably steal your
girl
* A scoreboard for when you want to feel proud about things that don't matter (I know I do since I am making this project and
feeling good about it, right? Raight? Guise?)
* Online multiplayer so you can race your friends at pressing buttons quickly so its basically Rocket League at that point. Lit.
