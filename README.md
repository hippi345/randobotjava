# randobotjava
A (now less) buggy JavaFx robot game I made to play with JavaFx concepts

Options include:
Setting the grid size for the game
Autoplay for when you are lazy
Manual play either with direction keys or have the game decide a move for you
Ability to exit or restart the game


# Future features
* Making it an actual game where the treasure is hidden and you have to find it like a pirate or whatever (Robot Pirates are
a thing, right? Right?)
* Gonna make this bot real smart so it can find the treasure quicker and in a future release it will probably steal your
girl
* A scoreboard for when you want to feel proud about things that don't matter (I know I do since I am making this project and
feeling good about it, right? Raight? Guise?)
* Online multiplayer so you can race your friends at pressing buttons quickly so its basically Rocket League at that point. Lit.
